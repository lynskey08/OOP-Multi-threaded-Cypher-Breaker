# OOP-Multi-threaded-Cypher-Breaker

##Gareth Lynskey

####Outline
This is a Multi threaded Cypher breaker using Java as the programming language with the Eclipse IDE. The idea is that a user enteres plain text into the console, it will then be encrypted. and then Cypher breaker will attempt to break it by using threads to Compare Key value pairs from the Quad Grams Text File against those Reuslts outputted from the blocking queue. The best or highest scoring key should be very similar or the same as the originally encrytped plain text that the user entered.
